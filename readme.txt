Manage footer code snippets from within WordPress. No need to edit your theme's footer.php file any more.

== Description ==

Footer Stuff allows you to manage footer code snippets (such as those for stats/analytics) from within WordPress. It eliminates the need to copy these snippets into your theme's PHP files, and lets you edit them through an options page located under WordPress' design tab. This makes it easier to edit these snippets and to switch themes. Version 1.0 lets you add stuff to the page's header as well.

== Installation ==

To install Footer Stuff, follow the steps below.

1. Upload the 'footer-stuff' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Manage the code snippets in at 'Design'->'Footer Stuff'

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I want to use this instead of editing my theme's footer.php file? =

For one thing, you wont's have to worry about these snippets when you switch themes. PHP files are also easy to mess up, so editing them can be tricky.

= Why would I want to use this instead of a dedicated plugin for my stats system? =

If you're using multiple stats systems, Footer Stuff lets you add the code in one place. And it lets add other things as well. If you know your way around HTML this is probably more convenient for you. And there simply isn't a dedicated plugin for every system out there.
